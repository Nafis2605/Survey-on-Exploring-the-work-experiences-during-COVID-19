abstract = {Objective
Communication related to COVID-19 between provider and the patient/family is impacted by isolation requirements, time limitations, and lack of family/partner access. Our goal was to determine the content of provider communication resources and peer-reviewed articles on COVID-19 communication in order to identify opportunities for developing future COVID-19 communication curricula and support tools.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using the UpToDate clinical decision support resource database, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. The grey literature review was conducted in September 2020 and articles published between January-September 2020 written in English were included.
Results
A total of 89 sources were included in the review, (n = 36 provider communication resources, n = 53 peer-reviewed articles). Resources were available for all providers, mainly physicians, and consisted of general approaches to COVID-19 communication with care planning as the most common topic. Only four resources met best practices for patient-centered communication. All but three articles described physician communication where a general emphasis on patient communication was the most prevalent topic. Reduced communication channels, absence of family, time, burnout, telemedicine, and reduced patient-centered care were identified as communication barriers. Communication facilitators were team communication, time, patient-centered and family communication, and available training resources.
Conclusions
Overall, resources lack content that address non-physician providers, communication with family, and strategies for telehealth communication to promote family engagement. The gaps identified in this review reveal a need to develop more materials on the following topics: provider moral distress, prevention communication, empathy and compassion, and grief and bereavement. An evidence-base and theoretical grounding in communication theory is also needed.
Practice implications
Future development of COVID-19 communication resources for providers should address members of the interdisciplinary team, communication with family, engagement strategies for culturally-sensitive telehealth interactions, and support for provider moral distress.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
In the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, the local health-care system was overwhelmed. Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published. We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak.
Methods
We did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method.
Findings
We recruited nine nurses and four physicians. Three theme categories emerged from data analysis. The first was “being fully responsible for patients' wellbeing—‘this is my duty’”. Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was “challenges of working on COVID-19 wards”. Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was “resilience amid challenges”. Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience.
Interpretation
The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally. Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers. Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.
Funding
National Key R&D Program of China, Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education in China.}

Findings reveal that the negative impact of pandemic on emerging stock markets has gradually fallen and begun to taper off by mid-April. In terms of regional classification, the impact of the outbreak has been the highest in Asian emerging markets whereas emerging markets in Europe have experienced the lowest. We also find that official response time and the size of stimulus package provided by the governments matter in offsetting the effects of the pandemic.}
